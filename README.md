This is my first website project.

The journey was awesome and leant new things via practicing.

The project is self explanatory as carausel and sliders are the only things in Js file.

As this is from Codesandbox, there are so many unwanted/ garbage files, you can ignore those.

# Needed Files:
* index.html
* styles.css
* index.js
